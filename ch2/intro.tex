This chapter will explain the major concepts that one needs to know about before attempting to implement a FLIP fluid solver. It will explain the theory behind the fluid equations and how to improve accuracy when dealing with discretization of differential equations. An overview of the overall FLIP algorithm is presented at the end of the chapter.
