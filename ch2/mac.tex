\subsection{MAC grid}

When storing quantities on a grid, it is common to store the values at the center of each cell. This approach can be tempting to use since it makes implementations clean and simple. However, there are different ways to store the quantities and the values do not necessary have to be stored at the center of the cell. An example of this is the \emph{Marker and Cell grid}, MAC grid, introduced by Harlow and Welch \cite{mac}.

\label{regulargrid}
\end{figure}
\noindent
Before we talk about the difference of a regular grid and a MAC grid, let us revisit derivative approximations. Figure \ref{regulargrid} shows a simple 2D-dimensional grid with the quanity $q_{i,j}$ stored at the center of each cell. To estimate the derivative of q in the x-direction, we can either use first order forward difference 

\begin{equation}
(\frac{\partial q}{\partial x})_{i,j} \approx \frac{q_{i+i,j} - q_{i,j}}{\Delta x}
\end{equation}

accurate to $O(\Delta x)$ or use first order central difference

\begin{equation}
(\frac{\partial q}{\partial x})_{i,j} \approx \frac{q_{i+i,j} - q_{i-1,j}}{2\Delta x}
\label{centraldifference}
\end{equation}

that has accuracy proportional to $O(\Delta x^{2})$. Even though central differencing is more accurate, we can make it even more accurate without having to use complicated approximations. To solve the Navier-Stokes equations later on we are going to need to approximate partial derivatives of both the velocity field $\vec{u}$ and the pressure field $p$. As we will see in later sections of this report, the partial derivative of the pressure field $\frac{\partial p}{\partial x}$ is going to be evaluated to update the velocity field $\vec{u}$. In a similar way, we will have to evaluate $\nabla \cdot \vec{u}$ in the linear equations to solve for pressure. This motivates the use of a staggered grid, i.e a grid where different variables are stored at different locations in the grid.

\begin{figure}[ht!]

\label{macgrid}
\end{figure}
\noindent
In Figure \ref{macgrid} we see a two-dimensional MAC grid. A MAC grid stores the pressure $p$ at the center of the cell and splits the vector field $\vec{u} = (u,v)$ into a component for each axis and store it on the edges of the cell, i.e. in this 2D example it splits $(u,v)$ and stores $u$ on the horizontal edges and $v$ on the vertical ones. At first, this might be confusing but when we evaluate the derivatives it should make more sense. To evaluate the divergence of $\vec{u}$ at the center of a cell $(i,j)$, we use central difference on the values stored at the edges.

\begin{equation}
\nabla \cdot \vec{u} = \frac{u_{i+1/2,j} - u_{i-1/2,j}}{\Delta x} + 
                       \frac{v_{i,j+1/2} - u_{i,j-1/2}}{\Delta x}
\end{equation}
\noindent
Compared to Equation \ref{centraldifference}, we only divide by $\Delta x$ instead of $2\Delta x$. In terms of implementation, the staggered grid does not have a larger memory footprint than a regular grid structure. In other ways, we get more accurate derivatives without slowing down the performance. To evaluate the derivative of the pressure $p$ at a edge we perform central difference on neighboring pressure values stored at the center.

\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial \rho_{i-1/2,j}}{\partial x} = \frac{\rho_{i,j} - \rho_{i-1,j}}{\Delta x}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial \rho_{i,j-1/2}}{\partial y} = \frac{\rho_{i,j} - \rho_{i,j-1}}{\Delta x}
\end{equation}
