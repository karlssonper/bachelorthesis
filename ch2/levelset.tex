\subsection{Level Set}

Liquid fluids, unlike gas fluids, have a surface. Tracking a surface is a non-trivial problem to solve due to the complex shape and the evolving change of topology. It is important to get the surface tracking accurate as we later on we need to know if a grid cell is inside, outside or on the surface when solving for pressure. To track the surface, we will use a level set \cite{osher}. A level set is a grid approach to track a surface. At each cell in the grid, a scalar $\phi_{i,j}$ is stored. This absolute value of the scalar tells us the closest distance to the surface. To know if we are inside, outside or on the actual surface we use the following notation:

\begin{equation}
\phi = 
\left\{
\begin{array}{ll}
\phi < 0 & \mbox{inside}  \\
\phi > 0 & \mbox{outside} \\
\phi = 0 & \mbox{surface} \\
\end{array}
\right.
\end{equation}
\noindent
Figure \ref{levetsetexample} shows an example of a surface and an interior and exterior area. Notice that if the surface is right on the center of a cell, $\phi$ is zero.

Another important feature of a level set is the gradient.

\begin{equation}
\nabla \phi = \hat{n}
\end{equation}

where $\hat{n}$ is the direction to the closest point of the surface. This means, given spatial coordinates $\vec{x}$, one can easily find the closest point $\vec{x}_s$ on the surface. 

\begin{equation}
\vec{x}_s = \vec{x} - \phi(\vec{x})\nabla \phi(\vec{x})
\end{equation}
\noindent
For any level set operator, it is important that the length of the gradient is always of unit length. This is called the Eikonal equation.

\begin{equation}
|\phi| = 1
