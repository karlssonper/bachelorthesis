\subsection{Transfer particle velocities to grid}

The first thing we need to do after advecting the particles is to transfer the particle velocities to our grid based velocity field. We are going to use the barycentric coordinates of a particle inside a cell to decide how much of the particle velocity is going to affect the neighboring velocities in the MAC grid. Since the velocities $u$ and $v$ are stored on different edges in the MAC grid, we need to be careful when we weight and transfer the particle velocities. The easy case would be when the particle position $\vec{x}_p$ is aligned exactly at the middle of the edge between two cells. Let us compare the difference between $u$ and $v$. 

\begin{figure}[ht!]

\label{onedge}
\end{figure}
\noindent
The particle position $\vec{x}_p$ in Figure \ref{onedge} is exactly at grid position $(i-1/2,j)$. It is reasonable that the horizontal component of the particle velocity $u_p$ only affects the edge at $u_{i-1/2,j}$. The vertical component $v_p$ is not exactly aligned with any vertical edge. This is where the barycentric coordinates come handy. The position $\vec{x}_p$ is exactly in the middle of the rectangle that the vertical edges $v_{i-1,j-1/2}, v_{i,j-1/2}, v_{i-1,j+1/2}, v_{i,j+1/2} $ spans. In this case, it makes sense that the vertical component of the particle velocity $v_p$ should affect the velocity field at all four vertical edges equally much since it it's in the middle of the rectangle.

What if there are multiple particles nearby? How do they all affect the velocities in the grid together? Figure \ref{fouredge} shows a case where multiple particles are close to a single velocity in the MAC grid. We need a way to weight the velocities so that particle velocities closer to an edge have more effect than the ones further away. The final velocity of an edge in the MAC grid is decided by

\begin{eqnarray}
u_{i-1/2,j} = \frac{\sum\limits_{i\in A}\omega_i(x_i) u_{i}}{\sum\limits_{i \in A}\omega_i(x_i)} \\
v_{i,j-1/2} = \frac{ \sum\limits_{i \in B}\lambda_i(x_i) v_{i}}{\sum\limits_{i \in B}\lambda_i(x_i)}
\label{weightsums}
\end{eqnarray}

where $A$ is the set of particles around a horizontal edge and $\omega(x_i)$ is the horizontal weighting function. $B$ is then the set of particles around a vertical edge and $\lambda(x_i)$ is the vertical weighting function.

Figure \ref{areaa} shows the difference between the sets $A$ and $B$. Updating one edge at a time would require a sophisticated way of only accessing particles close to a specific edge. If not, the time complexity for gathering particles in $A$ and $B$ would be $O(n)$ for each edge where $n$ is the total number of particles in the simulation. Instead, we will use a technique called splatting. In splatting approaches, you iterate over all the particles instead of all the grid cells. For each particle, we find out which edges it could affect. This is fast since each particle has a position and $A$ and $B$ have a fixed maximum size. The splatting method is divided into two parts. Part one can be seen in Algorithm \ref{particlestogridalgorithm1}. Notice that there is a temporary $sum$ MAC grid for storing the denominator part of Equation \ref{weightsums}.
\begin{algorithm}
\caption{Step one in splatting particle velocities to grid velocities}
\begin{algorithmic}
\STATE grid = empty mac grid
\STATE sum = empty mac grid
\FOR{all particles $p$}
\STATE tx,ty = barycentricA(p.x)
\FOR{neighboring horizontal edges $e$}
\STATE weight = omega(tx,ty, p.x)
\STATE grid.u[e.idx] += weight * p.u
\STATE sum.u[e.idx] += weight
\ENDFOR
\STATE tx,ty = barycentricB(p.x)
\FOR{neighboring vertical edges $e$}
\STATE weight = lambda(tx,ty, p.x)
\STATE grid.v[e.idx] += weight * p.v
\STATE sum.v[e.idx] += weight
\ENDFOR
\ENDFOR
\end{algorithmic}
\label{particlestogridalgorithm1}
\end{algorithm}
\newline
\newline
\noindent
The barycentric functions in Algorithm \ref{particlestogridalgorithm1} returns two normalized coordinates from $0$ to $1$ where bottom left of the region gives back $(0,0)$, bottom right $(1,0)$, top left $(0,1)$ and top right $(1,1)$. Anything in between is linearly interpolated.
\begin{algorithm}
\caption{Step two in splatting particle velocities to grid velocities}
\begin{algorithmic}
\FOR{$i=0$ to $N_x$}
\FOR{$j=0$ to $N_y$}
\STATE idx = .... get index for (i-1/2,j)
\STATE grid.u[idx] /= sum.u[idx]
\STATE idx = ... get index for (i,j-1/2)
\STATE grid.v[idx] /= sum.v[idx]
\ENDFOR
\ENDFOR
\end{algorithmic}
\label{particlestogridalgorithm2}
\end{algorithm}
\newline
\newline
\noindent
The second step of the splatting process is to normalize all the velocities. In Algorithm \ref{particlestogridalgorithm1} we only applied the numerator of Equation \ref{weightsums}. Once all velocities are splatted we also have the sum of all weights. If we divide the current edge velocity with the sum stored at each edge,  Equation \ref{weightsums} is true and the transfer from particles to grid is done.
